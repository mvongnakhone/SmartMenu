Many Thai chefs reformed kaeng ranchuan to restaurants after it was mentioned by culinary authority ML Nueang Ninrat, in a memoir explaining her life during the reign of King Rama V and VI. The people misunderstand about the origin and preparation of kaeng ranchuan because of famous TV series that do the wrong method of this dish and make people remember that this is the real kaeng ranchuan preparation method. So, the real kaeng ranchuan is in ML Ninrat book \"Life in the Palace\" she tells how her grandmother, the princess Sabai Ninrat created this dish. At the end of dinner there was leftovers so she asked her assistant to separate the meat from chili and basil. Then, she mixed it into a broth and added leftover of Nam prhrik kapi, so this is called the real kaeng ranchuan .",
